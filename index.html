                        <p>The list data type has some more methods. Here are all of the methods of list objects:
                            <br>
                        </p>

                        <p>list.
                            <strong>append</strong>(x)
                            <br> Add an item to the end of the list. Equivalent to a[len(a):] = [x].</p>
                        <p>list.
                            <strong>extend</strong>(L)
                            <br> Extend the list by appending all the items in the given list. Equivalent to a[len(a):] = L.</p>
                        <p>list.
                            <strong>insert</strong>(i, x)
                            <br> Insert an item at a given position. The first argument is the index of the element before which
                            to insert, so a.insert(0, x) inserts at the front of the list, and a.insert(len(a), x) is equivalent
                            to a.append(x).</p>
                        <p>list.
                            <strong>remove</strong>(x)
                            <br> Remove the first item from the list whose value is x. It is an error if there is no such item.</p>
                        <p>list.
                            <strong>pop</strong>([i])
                            <br> Remove the item at the given position in the list, and return it. If no index is specified,
                            a.pop() removes and returns the last item in the list. (The square brackets around the i in the
                            method signature denote that the parameter is optional, not that you should type square brackets
                            at that position. You will see this notation frequently in the Python Library Reference.)</p>
                        <p>list.
                            <strong>clear</strong>()
                            <br> Remove all items from the list. Equivalent to del a[:].</p>
                        <p>list.
                            <strong>index</strong>(x)
                            <br> Return the index in the list of the first item whose value is x. It is an error if there is
                            no such item.</p>
                        <p>list.
                            <strong>count</strong>(x)
                            <br> Return the number of times x appears in the list.</p>
                        <p>list.
                            <strong>sort</strong>()
                            <br>Sort the items of the list in place.</p>

                        <p> list.
                            <strong>reverse</strong>()
                            <br> Reverse the elements of the list in place.</p>
                        <p>list.
                            <strong>copy</strong>()
                            <br> Return a shallow copy of the list. Equivalent to a[:].</p> An example that uses most of the
                        list methods:</p>

                        <p>You might have noticed that methods like insert, remove or sort that modify the list have no return
                            value printed – they return None.

                            It is also possible to use a list as a queue, where the first element added is the first element retrieved (“first-in, first-out”);
                            however, lists are not efficient for this purpose. While appends and pops from the end of list
                            are fast, doing inserts or pops from the beginning of a list is slow (because all of the other
                            elements have to be shifted by one).
                        </p>
                        <p>To implement a queue, use collections.deque which was designed to have fast appends and pops from
                            both ends. For example:</p>
                        <pre><code>

    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> stack.append(6)

    [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]

    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> stack
    [3, 4, 5, 6]

                        <p>List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. Common applications are to make new lists
                            where each element is the result of some operations applied to each member of another sequence
                            or iterable, or to create a subsequence of those elements that satisfy a certain condition.
                        </p>
                        <p>For example, assume we want to create a list of squares, like:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> squares = []
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> for x in range(10):
    ...     squares.append(x**2)
    ...
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> squares
    [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

</code></pre>
                        <p>We can obtain the same result with:</p>
                        <pre><code>
    squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)] 

</code></pre>
                        <p>This is also equivalent to squares = list(map(lambda x: x**2, range(10))), but it’s more concise
                            and readable.</p>
                        <p>A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then
                            zero or more for or if clauses. The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression
                            in the context of the for and if clauses which follow it. For example, this listcomp combines
                            the elements of two lists if they are not equal:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> [(x, y) for x in [1,2,3] for y in [3,1,4] if x != y]
    (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]

</code></pre>
                        <p>and it’s equivalent to:</p>
                        <pre><code>
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> combs = []
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> for x in [1,2,3]:
    ...     for y in [3,1,4]:
    ...         if x != y:
    ...             combs.append((x, y))
    ...
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> combs
    [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)]

</code></pre>

                        <p>Note how the order of the for and if statements is the same in both these snippets.</p>
                        <p>If the expression is a tuple (e.g. the (x, y) in the previous example), it must be parenthesized.</p>
                        <pre><code>

                        <p>There is a way to remove an item from a list given its index instead of its value: the

                            can also be used to remove slices from a list or clear the entire list (which we did earlier
                            by assignment of an empty list to the slice). For example:</p>
                        <pre><code>
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> a = [-1, 1, 66.25, 333, 333, 1234.5]

                        <p>del can also be used to delete entire variables:</p>

                        <p>We saw that lists and strings have many common properties, such as indexing and slicing operations.
                            They are two examples of sequence data types (see Sequence Types — list, tuple, range). Since
                            Python is an evolving language, other sequence data types may be added. There is also another
                            standard sequence data type: the tuple.</p>
                        <p>A tuple consists of a number of values separated by commas, for instance:</p>
                        <pre><code>
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!'
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> t[0]
    12345

    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> u
    ((12345, 54321, 'hello!'), (1, 2, 3, 4, 5))

</code></pre>
                        <p>As you see, on output tuples are always enclosed in parentheses, so that nested tuples are interpreted
                            correctly; they may be input with or without surrounding parentheses, although often parentheses
                            are necessary anyway (if the tuple is part of a larger expression). It is not possible to assign
                            to the individual items of a tuple, however it is possible to create tuples which contain mutable
                            objects, such as lists.</p>
                        <p>Though tuples may seem similar to lists, they are often used in different situations and for different
                            purposes. Tuples are immutable, and usually contain an heterogeneous sequence of elements that
                            are accessed via unpacking (see later in this section) or indexing (or even by attribute in the
                            case of namedtuples). Lists are mutable, and their elements are usually homogeneous and are accessed
                            by iterating over the list.</p>
                        <p>A special problem is the construction of tuples containing 0 or 1 items: the syntax has some extra
                            quirks to accommodate these. Empty tuples are constructed by an empty pair of parentheses; a
                            tuple with one item is constructed by following a value with a comma (it is not sufficient to
                            enclose a single value in parentheses). Ugly, but effective. For example:</p>
                        <Pre><code>
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> empty = ()
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> singleton = 'hello',    # <-- note trailing     comma
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> len(empty)
    0
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> len(singleton)
    1
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> singleton
    ('hello',)  

</code></Pre>
                        <p>The statement t = 12345, 54321, 'hello!' is an example of tuple packing: the values 12345, 54321
                            and 'hello!' are packed together in a tuple. The reverse operation is also possible:</p>
                        <pre><code>
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> x, y, z = t 

</code></pre>
                        <p>This is called, appropriately enough, sequence unpacking and works for any sequence on the right-hand
                            side. Sequence unpacking requires that there are as many variables on the left side of the equals
                            sign as there are elements in the sequence. Note that multiple assignment is really just a combination
                            of tuple packing and sequence unpacking.</p>

                        <p>Python also includes a data type for sets. A set is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements.
                            Basic uses include membership testing and eliminating duplicate entries. Set objects also support
                            mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.</p>
                        <p>Curly braces or the set() function can be used to create sets. Note: to create an empty set you have
                            to use set(), not {}; the latter creates an empty dictionary, a data structure that we discuss
                            in the next section.</p>
                        <p>Here is a brief demonstration:</p>
                        <pre><code>

    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> basket = {'apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana'}

    True
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> 'crabgrass' in basket
    False
    
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> # Demonstrate set operations on unique letters from two words
    ...
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> a = set('abracadabra')
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> b = set('alacazam')
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> a                                  # unique letters in a
    {'a', 'r', 'b', 'c', 'd'}
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> a - b                              # letters in a but not in b
    {'r', 'd', 'b'}
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> a | b                              # letters in either a or b
    {'a', 'c', 'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> a & b                              # letters in both a and b
    {'a', 'c'}
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> a ^ b                              # letters in a or b but not both
    {'r', 'd', 'b', 'm', 'z', 'l'}  

</code></pre>
                        <p>Similarly to list comprehensions, set comprehensions are also supported:</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>Another useful data type built into Python is the dictionary (see Mapping Types — dict). Dictionaries
                            are sometimes found in other languages as “associative memories” or “associative arrays”. Unlike
                            sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, which can
                            be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys. Tuples can be used as keys if
                            they contain only strings, numbers, or tuples; if a tuple contains any mutable object either
                            directly or indirectly, it cannot be used as a key. You can’t use lists as keys, since lists
                            can be modified in place using index assignments, slice assignments, or methods like append()
                            and extend().</p>
                        <p>It is best to think of a dictionary as an unordered set of key: value pairs, with the requirement
                            that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary:
                            {}. Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value
                            pairs to the dictionary; this is also the way dictionaries are written on output.</p>
                        <p>The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and extracting the value given
                            the key. It is also possible to delete a key:value pair with del. If you store using a key that
                            is already in use, the old value associated with that key is forgotten. It is an error to extract
                            a value using a non-existent key.</p>
                        <p>Performing list(d.keys()) on a dictionary returns a list of all the keys used in the dictionary,
                            in arbitrary order (if you want it sorted, just use sorted(d.keys()) instead).
                            <a href="#footnotes" class="smoothScroll">[2]</a> To check whether a single key is in the dictionary, use the in keyword.</p>
                        <p>Here is a small example using a dictionary:</p>
                        <pre><code>
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span>tel = {'jack': 4098, 'sape': 4139} 
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span>tel['guido'] = 4127 
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span>tel {'sape': 4139, 'guido': 4127, 'jack': 4098} 
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span>tel['jack'] 4098 
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span>del tel['sape'] 
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span>tel['irv'] = 4127 
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span>tel {'guido': 4127, 'irv': 4127, 'jack': 4098} 
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span>list(tel.keys()) ['irv', 'guido', 'jack'] 
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span>sorted(tel.keys()) ['guido', 'irv', 'jack']
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span>'guido' in tel True 
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span>'jack' not in tel False
    

</code></pre>
                        <p>The dict() constructor builds dictionaries directly from sequences of key-value pairs:</p>
                        <pre><code>
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> dict([('sape', 4139), ('guido', 4127), ('jack', 4098)])
    {'sape': 4139, 'jack': 4098, 'guido': 4127}

</code></pre>
                        <p>In addition, dict comprehensions can be used to create dictionaries from arbitrary key and value
                            expressions:
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> {x: x**2 for x in (2, 4, 6)}
    {2: 4, 4: 16, 6: 36}

</code></pre>
                        <p>When the keys are simple strings, it is sometimes easier to specify pairs using keyword arguments:</p>
                        <pre><code>
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> dict(sape=4139, guido=4127, jack=4098)
    {'sape': 4139, 'jack': 4098, 'guido': 4127}

                        <p>When looping through dictionaries, the key and corresponding value can be retrieved at the same time
                            using the items() method.</p>
                        <pre><code>
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> knights = {'gallahad': 'the pure', 'robin': 'the brave'}
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> for k, v in knights.items():
    ...     print(k, v)
        ...
    gallahad the pure
    robin the brave

</code></pre>
                        <p>When looping through a sequence, the position index and corresponding value can be retrieved at the
                            same time using the enumerate() function.</p>
                        <pre><code>
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> for i, v in enumerate(['tic', 'tac', 'toe']):
    ...     print(i, v)
    ...
    0 tic
    1 tac
    2 toe

</code></pre>
                        <p>
                            To loop over two or more sequences at the same time, the entries can be paired with the zip() function.
                        </p>
                        <pre><code>
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> questions = ['name', 'quest', 'favorite color']
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> answers = ['lancelot', 'the holy grail', 'blue']
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> for q, a in zip(questions, answers):
    ...     print('What is your {0}?  It is {1}.'.format(q, a))
    ...
    What is your name?  It is lancelot.
    What is your quest?  It is the holy grail.
    What is your favorite color?  It is blue.

</code></pre>
                        <p>To loop over a sequence in reverse, first specify the sequence in a forward direction and then call
                            the reversed() function. </p>
                        <pre><code>

    ...     print(i)
    ...
    9
    7
    5
    3
    1

</code></pre>
                        <p>To loop over a sequence in sorted order, use the sorted() function which returns a new sorted list
                            while leaving the source unaltered.</p>
                        <pre><code>
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> basket = ['apple', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'orange', 'banana']
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> for f in sorted(set(basket)):
    ...     print(f)
    ...
    apple
    banana
    orange
    pear
</code></pre>
                        <p>To change a sequence you are iterating over while inside the loop (for example to duplicate certain
                            items), it is recommended that you first make a copy. Looping over a sequence does not implicitly
                            make a copy. The slice notation makes this especially convenient:</p>
                        <pre><code>
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> for w in words[:]:  # Loop over a slice copy of the entirelist.
    ...     if len(w) > 6:
    ...         words.insert(0, w)
    ...
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> words
    ['defenestrate', 'cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']

                        <p>The conditions used in while and if statements can contain any operators, not just comparisons.</p>
                        <p>The comparison operators in and not in check whether a value occurs (does not occur) in a sequence.
                            The operators is and is not compare whether two objects are really the same object; this only
                            matters for mutable objects like lists. All comparison operators have the same priority, which
                            is lower than that of all numerical operators.</p>
                        Comparisons can be chained. For example, a
                        < b==c tests whether a is less than b and moreover b equals c.</p></b>
                            <p>Comparisons may be combined using the Boolean operators and and or, and the outcome of a comparison
                                (or of any other Boolean expression) may be negated with not. These have lower priorities
                                than comparison operators; between them, not has the highest priority and or the lowest,
                                so that A and not B or C is equivalent to (A and (not B)) or C. As always, parentheses can
                                be used to express the desired composition.</p>
                            <p>The Boolean operators and and or are so-called short-circuit operators: their arguments are evaluated
                                from left to right, and evaluation stops as soon as the outcome is determined. For example,
                                if A and C are true but B is false, A and B and C does not evaluate the expression C. When
                                used as a general value and not as a Boolean, the return value of a short-circuit operator
                                is the last evaluated argument.</p>
                            <p>It is possible to assign the result of a comparison or other Boolean expression to a variable.
                                For example, </p>
                            <pre><code>
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> string1, string2, string3 = '', 'Trondheim', 'Hammer Dance'
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> non_null = string1 or string2 or string3
    <span class="arrow3">>>></span> non_null
    'Trondheim'

</code></pre>
                            <p>Note that in Python, unlike C, assignment cannot occur inside expressions. C programmers may
                                grumble about this, but it avoids a common class of problems encountered in C programs: typing
                                = in an expression when == was intended.

                        </header>
                        <p>Sequence objects may be compared to other objects with the same sequence type. The comparison uses
                            lexicographical ordering: first the first two items are compared, and if they differ this determines
                            the outcome of the comparison; if they are equal, the next two items are compared, and so on,
                            until either sequence is exhausted. If two items to be compared are themselves sequences of the
                            same type, the lexicographical comparison is carried out recursively. If all items of two sequences
                            compare equal, the sequences are considered equal. If one sequence is an initial sub-sequence
                            of the other, the shorter sequence is the smaller (lesser) one. Lexicographical ordering for
                            strings uses the Unicode codepoint number to order individual characters. Some examples of comparisons
                            between sequences of the same type:</p>
                        <pre><code>
    (1, 2, 3)              < (1, 2, 4)
    [1, 2, 3]              < [1, 2, 4]
    'ABC' < 'C' < 'Pascal' < 'Python'
    (1, 2, 3, 4)           < (1, 2, 4)
    (1, 2)                 < (1, 2, -1)
    (1, 2, 3)             == (1.0, 2.0, 3.0)
    (1, 2, ('aa', 'ab'))   < (1, 2, ('abc', 'a'), 4)
    
</code></pre>
                        <p>Note that comparing objects of different types with
                            < or> is legal provided that the objects have appropriate comparison methods. For example, mixed numeric
                                types are compared according to their numeric value, so 0 equals 0.0, etc. Otherwise, rather
                                than providing an arbitrary ordering, the interpreter will raise a TypeError exception.
